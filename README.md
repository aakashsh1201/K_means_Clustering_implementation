K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that is used to solve the clustering problems in machine learning.
It computes centroids and repeats until the optimal centroid is found.
This repository depicts sequential implementation of K_means clustering algorithm on mall transactions dataset which can be very
useful in analyzing the target audience.
